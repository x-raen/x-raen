**Cybersecurity Researcher | Exploit Engineer | Reverse Engineering Specialist | ROP/JOP Chain Architect | Systems Hacker**

Welcome to my professional profile. I specialize in offensive security research with a strong focus on kernel exploitation, firmware reverse engineering, and the development of modular payload systems tailored for next-gen console environments and embedded devices.

With a deep mastery of most programming languages—from low-level assembly to high-level scripting—I create tools and frameworks designed for adaptability, clarity, and precision. My work combines symbolic execution, dynamic analysis, and chain synthesis to push the boundaries of modern exploitation.

## Featured Projects

### EchoShift – Intelligent ROP/JOP Chain Rebuilder
*A smart relocation engine designed to port exploitation chains across firmware versions and environments.*

EchoShift is a transformative framework built for exploit engineers who need reliability and scalability. It dissects existing chains, evaluates gadget equivalency, and automatically reconstructs new payloads using symbolic analysis and semantic mapping.

- Semantic Disassembly Unit (SDU)
- Advanced Gadget Equivalency Engine (AGEE)
- Chain Reconstruction & Linker (RPU)
- Fully documented, extensible, and integration-ready

### LoadStitch – Kernel Payload Modular Builder
*A dynamic, environment-aware loader system for kernel payloads in custom firmware ecosystems.*

LoadStitch empowers developers to craft kernel payloads with precision using plug-and-play modules. It supports dynamic load matrices, persistent patching, and hybrid environments (WebKit + Kernel chains).

- Modular payload units with dependency parsing
- Dynamic dispatch tree based on runtime conditions
- Patching logic for kernel adaptation
- Built for PS4/PS5 custom environments

## Technical Philosophy

I believe in **clear logic, modular design, and intelligent automation**.  
Every tool I build is meant to be as efficient in execution as it is elegant in architecture.

**Languages & Skills:**  
C, C++, Rust, Python, Bash, ARM/x86 Assembly, JavaScript, PHP, Go, Swift, and more.

**Tools of Choice:**  
Capstone, Unicorn Engine, Z3 Solver, Ghidra, QEMU, IDA Pro, Radare2, Frida

**Core Focus Areas:**  
- Automated ROP chain generation  
- Firmware diffing and patch-based exploitation  
- Embedded system security  
- Symbolic & emulated execution  
- Binary protocol analysis

## Final Note

This repository represents a curated set of private research and custom tooling developed over years of hands-on work. Every line of code reflects a precise understanding of both the system and the challenge at hand.
